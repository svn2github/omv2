Description: An AirPlay-compatible audio receiver
 This program emulates an AirPort Express for the purpose of streaming
 audio from iTunes, iPods, iPhones, iPads and AppleTVs. Audio played by
 a Shairport Sync-powered device stays synchronised with the source and
 hence with similar devices playing the same source. Thus, for example,
 synchronised multi-room audio is possible without difficulty.
 This program does not support AirPlay video or photo streaming.
